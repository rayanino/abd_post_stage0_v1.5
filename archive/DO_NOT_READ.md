# STOP — DO NOT READ FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

Everything in `archive/` is **deprecated and superseded**. Reading these files will cause confusion with outdated rules that contradict current authority.

## What's here (and why it's dangerous)

### `legacy_orientation/`
Old onboarding files (READ_FIRST.md, PROJECT_PROMPT.md, SESSION_CONTEXT.md) that contradict the current `CLAUDE.md`. Do not follow any instructions from these files.

### `precision_deprecated/`
Old binding decisions (v0.3.10, v0.3.15) and old checklists (v0.3) that are **superseded** by:
- `2_atoms_and_excerpts/00_BINDING_DECISIONS_v0.3.16.md` (current)
- `2_atoms_and_excerpts/checklists_v0.4.md` (current)

Reading the old versions will lead to incorrect excerpting and validation decisions.

## Where to find current authority

1. `CLAUDE.md` — project orientation and design principles
2. `2_atoms_and_excerpts/00_BINDING_DECISIONS_v0.3.16.md` — binding rules
3. `2_atoms_and_excerpts/checklists_v0.4.md` — validation checklists
4. `4_excerpting/EXCERPT_DEFINITION.md` — single source of truth for excerpts
