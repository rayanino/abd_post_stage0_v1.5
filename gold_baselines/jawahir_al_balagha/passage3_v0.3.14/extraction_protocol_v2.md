> This file is intentionally a **minimal stub** to avoid ambiguity.
> The *binding* extraction protocol is the repo-level canon:

> - `ABD/2_atoms_and_excerpts/extraction_protocol_v2.4.md`
>
> Canonical schema:
> - `ABD/schemas/gold_standard_schema_v0.3.3.json`

> If anything conflicts, **repo-level canon wins**.
