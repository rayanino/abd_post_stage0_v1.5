## Why this stub exists
Earlier Passage 3 packaging carried a passage-local snapshot whose *internal body* referenced older file versions.
Even with top banners, that increases the risk that a future builder skims the body and absorbs obsolete versioning.

To preserve provenance while eliminating ambiguity:
- The **full historical snapshot** is retained at:
  - `_SCRATCH/snapshots/00_BINDING_DECISIONS_v0.3.8.snapshot.md`
- This root-level file remains as the **single, unambiguous pointer** to the canonical governance.
