# Project Glossary (stub)

> **NON-CANONICAL SNAPSHOT STUB (Passage-local)**
>
> This file is intentionally a **minimal stub** to avoid ambiguity.
> The *binding* ABD glossary is the repo-level canon:
>
> - `ABD/project_glossary.md` (version 1.2.0)
>
> The original passage-3 snapshot was version ~1.0.0 and contained severely
> outdated content: wrong pipeline stages ("four stages: input preparation →
> atomization → excerpting → synthesis"), stale file references
> (`excerpt_definition_draft.md`, `extraction_protocol.md`), old binding
> decisions version (v0.3.8 vs current v0.3.16), and wrong science ID (`imla`
> instead of `imlaa`).
>
> If anything conflicts, **repo-level canon wins**.
