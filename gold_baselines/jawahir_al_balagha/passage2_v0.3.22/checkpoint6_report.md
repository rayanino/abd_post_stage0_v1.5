# Checkpoint 6 — Validation + Packaging

## Authoritative validation record
The authoritative validation result for this baseline is recorded in:
- `passage2_metadata.json` → `validation.*`
- `checkpoint_outputs/cp6_validate.stdout.txt`

Do **not** treat any hard-coded warning/error counts or validator-version text outside those sources as authoritative.
